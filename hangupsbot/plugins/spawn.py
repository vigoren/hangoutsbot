"""
Spawn arbitrary commands asynchronously (as the bot user)

Stdout goes back to the main hangout
Stderr goes back to a private 1:1

We expect a "spawn" configuration dictionary in config.json.  The
dictionary can appear in two places.  It -must- appear at the main
level, it -may- also appear at the per-conversation level, but any
per-conversation structure may not override the name of the command or
whether it is an admin command or not.

    "spawn": {
        "home": "/nonstandard/home/directory",
        "commands":
            "fortune": {
                "command": ["/usr/games/fortune"]
            },
            "motd": {    <---this is a deliberately unsecure example
                "command": ["/bin/cat", "/etc/motd", "--"],
                "allow_args": true
            },
            "stock-info": {
                "command": ["/home/portfolio/stock-info", "--"]
                "home": "/home/portfolio",
                "allow_args": true
        }
    }

Security notes:

While some attempt at security has been made, it's neither guaranteed or
complete.  If you're running the bot as a privlieged user, you get what
you deserve when you get hacked, and we will all laugh at you when you
share your sad story.

If `allow_args` has been set to true, any arguments passed in by the user
are also passed to the program.  *Use this with caution*, and also consider
ending your commands with '--' to avoid allowing users to masqurade
arguments as options, should that be an issue for a particular command.

While the shell is bypassed, so no file redirection or command chanining
is allowed (e.g. `/bot motd ; rm -rf /` will fail), if `allow_args` is
true, you are passing unsanitised arguments off to a command.  Even if,
as in the `motd` example above, where the command has '--' as part of it,
so that the user cannot pass in any additional switch based arguments,
unintended consequences can occur:

    /bot motd /etc/passwd

would execute:

    ['/bin/cat', '/etc/motd', '--',  '/etc/passwd']

which will, of course, send back `/etc/passwd`.

You're responsible for sanitizing any arguments passed on to the
program, if `allow_args` is true. Writing your own small shell
script to do so may be your best option.
